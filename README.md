# Live Cell Timelapse Apoptosis Analysis

This repository contains the code to analyze live cell timelapse microscopy data of apoptosis in HeLa cells.
The goal of this analysis repository is to build a pipeline and framework to analyze live cell timelapse microscopy data modes.
Specifically, multi-channel fluorescence microscopy data.

The sample data and upstream analysis of such data, including image analysis with CellProfiler and image-profiling with CytoTable and pycytominer, can be found in the sibling repository [live_cell_timelapse_apoptosis](https://github.com/WayScience/live_cell_timelapse_apoptosis).

All analysis here is done with output single cell profiles of cells from the upstream analysis.
